# Rick and Morty slider

## Description

The task is to fetch content (photos) from an API (you donâ€™t need to load real data from Instagram/Facebook/Twitter but instead you should mock the server call) and display that content in several different layouts (Grid, Carousel/Slider, and Cards). We recommend using React to build a web app (as we use it for our product) and TypeScript (if you know TS) that will fetch photos and information from an API. The app should display photos and descriptions of each photo. The user should be able to switch layout between a list view, grid view and carousel view.
